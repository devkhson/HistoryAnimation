# OpenHistoryAnimation
learn history from animation not book

# Why make this
Every time I learn about history, It's so boring.  
At that time, I just imagine that if there is anime like [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) or [3 Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_of_the_Three_Kingdoms_(video_game_series)), how can it be bored?  
Let's make it.  

# How it work
First user enter homepage, and click story about what they want.  
In stroy board, there are map and time line which user can control time flow.  
Depend on time, map create events to link to anime.  

# How make this
I need 2 skills which Web-based frontend and anime tool.  
I choose Vue for front and blender for back.
